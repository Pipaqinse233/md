From a young age, I was taught to be kind to people around. My parents <u>**1**</u> explained to me the importance of giving help generously to the less <u>**2**</u>. So out of habit, whenever there is something I can <u>**3**</u> I give it to someone on the streets.   

Last week, as I left the house for work, I carried with me some <u>**4**</u> clothes, a handbag and some food to hand over to someone <u>**5**</u>.   

As the car <u>**6**</u> at a traffic red light, I saw a girl of five or six asking for money. I <u>**7**</u> her to come to me and quickly <u>**8**</u> all the *stuff*(物品) I had and put them into the handbag. As I started handing it over, she seemed <u>**9**</u> She looked up at me with a sweet smile on her face and asked what was in the <u>**10**</u>. I told her there were some clothes and food for her.   

Once again she <u>**11**</u> me,"Can you give me some water?" It was then that I noticed her dry lips. It seemed that she had not had a drop of water all day. I took out the water bottle that I always carry with me and helped her to drink from it. She finished it quickly and gave me a  heartwarming smile of <u>**12**</u>.   

I was thankful that I could <u>**13**</u> what she really wished and realized once again that day that you don't  necessarily have to make big donations to help someone. And this incident, as well as a lot that followed, <u>**14**</u> my belief in the simple acts of kindness and how they can make someone's day. Next time you want to do something nice for someone, don't <u>**15**</u> seizing the right opportunity, or it would be late. Go ahead and do it!
