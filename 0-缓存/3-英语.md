In the seventh grade when my mother suggested that I should join the golf team, I thought she had lost her mind. But as usual, my mother <u>**1**</u> in the end. I played on the middle-school golf team in the seventh and eighth grade. The summer before high school came, I was <u>**42**</u> to join the high school team.   

That summer I <u>**43**</u> almost every Sunday morning on the golf course with my <u>**4**</u> and too many afternoons with my mother. This <u>**45**</u> relationship with my parents <u>**46**</u> during my high school years. <u>**47**</u> you're walking down the freshly *mowed fairway*(修剪的平坦球道), looking out across miles of nothing but golf course, and looking up at the beautiful blue sky, you will realize what is <u>**48**</u> in life. My mom and I <u>**49**</u> many things in the middle of
a round of golf that we would never do at <u>**50**</u>, where she is Mom and I am an annoying teenager. On the golf course, we're just two people who <u>**51**</u> golf.   

During the past years golfing has become a part of my <u>**52**</u>. My friends know in the summer the place to find me is on the golf course. There is <u>**53**</u> I love more than a perfect autumn morning, riding around in a *golf cart*(球车) with my dad. Golf has <u>**54**</u> me and made me into the person I am today. And I have to <u>**55**</u> that all of it is thanks to my mom who made me join that middle-school golf team. In fact, she was right.
